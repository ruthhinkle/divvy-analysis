# Divvy'in Up Data

# 📝 Project Description
This project analyzes anonymized data from Divvy, a rideshare biking service in Chicago, IL. We chose to examine data in the third quarter of 2019 which includes the summer months and high volume of riders compared to other quarters. Our analysis examines relationships between gender, age, yearly subscribers and one-off customers, in addition to popular routes, bikes, and stations.

# 🔎 Questions to Answer
We wanted to uncover interesting patterns in the data. We asked ourselves:
* Are there routes and stations that are more popular than others?
* Are there any specific bikes that were rented a surprising amount?
* Are there any relationships between the age and/or gender when comparing one-time customers or yearly subscribers?
* How long, on average, are trips made by Divvy bike?

# 📊 Observations
* **Subscribers vs Customers:** 
    * 84% of riders during this time frame were yearly subscribers rather than riders who pay for one-off rides. 
* **Gender:**
    * Overall, male-identified riders comprised 70% of total ridership. 
    * One-time customers showed a similar 70/30 breakdown compared to yearly subscribers which were slightly more balanced with a 60/40 breakdown.
* **Age:**
    * Riders aged 20-29 made up 47% of overall ridership with people aged 30-39 coming in second with 30% of overall ridership. 
    * The breakdown per usertype, customer versus subscriber, was similar to the overall categories. 

 # 🧼 Data Clean Up & Observations
 * mention missing values for genders and also limited gender options (significant in a city w/ large queer population)
 * summarize other clean up steps
