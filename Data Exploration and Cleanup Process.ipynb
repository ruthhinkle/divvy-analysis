    "This project analyzes anonymized data from Divvy, a rideshare biking service in Chicago, IL. We chose to examine data in the third quarter of 2019 which includes the summer months and high volume of riders compared to other quarters. \n",

    "* Are there routes and stations that are more popular than others?\n",
    "* Are there any specific bikes that were rented a surprising amount?\n",

    "**Popular Stations**\n",
    "* The most popular station by far is Streeter Dr. and Grand Ave. which is located on Navy Pier. It is a popular destination for both tourists and locals. Indeed, this station appeared as either the starting or ending station on many of the most popular routes. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Popular Routes**\n",
    "* All of the most frequented routes were in the loop and along the lakefront. Without knowing, we suspect that this is again a combination of tourists and commuters making use of the bikes in downtown Chicago. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Customers vs. Subscribers:** \n",
    "* There are far more subscribers than customers who ride in the Chicago Divvy network, about 84% to 16%\n",
    "* This data may be skewed. We made an early call to drop any data with null values. We suspect that the dropped cells are more likely to be customers, one-time or infrequent users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gender:**\n",
    "* There are far more male Divvy riders than female - about 70% to 30%.\n",
    "* It is fairly the same gender breakdown when it comes to customer (about 70/30) and subscriber (about 60/40).\n",
    "* Divvy did not collect gender data beyond male and female, which means portions of Chicago's non-binary population are not accounted for in this dataset. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Age:**\n",
    "* Riders aged 20-29 made up 47% of overall ridership with people aged 30-39 coming in second with 30% of overall ridership.\n",
    "* The breakdown per usertype, customer versus subscriber, was similar to the overall categories. "
